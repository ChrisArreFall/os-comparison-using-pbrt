## A Comparative Analysis of Operating System Performance: Rendering with pbrt-v3 across Multiple Scenarios

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the operating system, scene complexity, and rendering algorithm on the rendering time efficiency of a computer graphics program. A dataset consisting of 400 observations was collected and thoroughly analyzed. After conducting an exploratory data analysis, we used a three-way ANOVA to dissect the complex interactions between these factors. Results indicate that all three factors have a substantial impact on rendering time efficiency, both independently and in interaction with one another. Significant insights were gained regarding the optimization strategies for software development, particularly towards improving rendering efficiency under different operating system environments, scene complexities, and algorithms. Future research is suggested to corroborate these findings and further explore strategies to minimize rendering time in computer graphics applications.
