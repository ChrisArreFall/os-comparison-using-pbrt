This analysis suggests that both the OS and the selected
scene and algorithm significantly influence rendering times.
Further investigation into why macOS outperforms other oper-
ating systems and how specific scenes and algorithms interact
with OS could lead to optimizations and improved rendering
performance.

While this analysis provides valuable insights into the fac-
tors influencing rendering times, it is not without limitations.
The stringent Leveneâ€™s test, despite data transformation, sug-
gests that heteroscedasticity might be an issue. Future analyses
may explore robust statistical techniques that do not assume
homogeneity of variances, such as the Welch ANOVA or non-
parametric alternatives. Additionally, further research into the
mechanisms underlying the observed performance differences
could help inform software development and hardware opti-
mization strategies.
