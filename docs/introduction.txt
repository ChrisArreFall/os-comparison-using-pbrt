In the complex ecosystem of computing, operating systems serve as a crucial interface between users and the hardware of a computer system. These systems vary significantly in design, functionality, efficiency, and compatibility, thus presenting various implications on the overall system performance. To better understand these implications, this study aims to evaluate the performance of five distinct scenarios: Linux installed on hardware, Linux running on a Virtual Machine (VM) via Windows through VMware, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows, and MacOS.

Our evaluation metrics focus on the use of pbrt-v3, an open-source rendering system, which has been widely used in both academia and industry due to its emphasis on physical accuracy, extensibility, and its ability to produce high-quality rendered images. In our experiments, we have selected four unique configurations: bounding volume hierarchy (bvh), kdtree, Mitchell-Netravali filter (mitchell), and windowed sinc filter (sinc). Each configuration introduces different algorithms and filters, ultimately affecting the overall system performance and quality of the rendered images.
