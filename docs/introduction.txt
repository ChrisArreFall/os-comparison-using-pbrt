In the complex ecosystem of computing, operating systems serve as a crucial interface between users and the hardware of a computer system. These systems vary significantly in design, functionality, efficiency, and compatibility, thus presenting various implications on the overall system performance. To better understand these implications, this study aims to evaluate the performance of five distinct scenarios: Linux installed on hardware, Linux running on a Virtual Machine (VM) via Windows through VMware, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows, and MacOS.

Our evaluation metrics focus on the use of pbrt-v3, an open-source rendering system, which has been widely used in both academia and industry due to its emphasis on physical accuracy, extensibility, and its ability to produce high-quality rendered images. In our experiments, we have selected four unique configurations: bounding volume hierarchy (bvh), kdtree, Mitchell-Netravali filter (mitchell), and windowed sinc filter (sinc). Each configuration introduces different algorithms and filters, ultimately affecting the overall system performance and quality of the rendered images.

In addition to this, four different scenes, namely coffee-splash, ganesha, pbrt-book, and sssdragon, are selected from the official pbrt-v3 scene repository. These scenes add further dimensions to the evaluation, emphasizing varying levels of complexity and detail, thus challenging the rendering capabilities of the tested operating systems.

In total, this experiment will run each operating system through each scene and configuration, amounting to 80 unique scenarios. To ensure robustness and reliability in our results, each scenario will be repeated five times. This comprehensive and rigorous study design allows us to isolate the effect of the operating system on the rendering performance, presenting valuable insights and potential recommendations for both end users and developers alike.

As we delve deeper into the paper, we will discuss the methodological details, followed by an in-depth analysis of the performance outcomes across all tested scenarios. Ultimately, our findings will shed light on the complex interplay between operating systems, rendering systems, and the underlying configurations, providing a solid foundation for future research and optimization in the field.
