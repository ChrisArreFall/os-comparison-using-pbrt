The collected data was initially preprocessed using Google Sheets, converted into .csv format for compatibility, and then imported into the R programming environment for rigorous statistical analysis.

A multifactorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was the selected statistical approach for analyzing the data. This method takes into account all the three factors under consideration: the Operating System, the Scene, and the Configuration (Algorithm). The ANOVA model was implemented in R as follows:

# Multifactorial ANOVA model
model = lm(Time ~ OS*Scene*Algorithm, data=Data)

# Perform ANOVA using type II sum of squares
library(car)
Anova(model, type="II")

The chosen methodology, ANOVA, is expected to provide a detailed understanding of both the individual and interactive effects of the operating system, scene, and configuration on rendering time. This detailed interpretation will help to uncover the key drivers behind the performance differences in the operating system scenarios.
