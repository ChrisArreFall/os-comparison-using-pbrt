The dataset consisted of 400 observations, spanning mul-
tiple variables, including the operating system (OS), Scene,
and Algorithm. Visualization of the data revealed a consistent
performance order across different operating systems, with
macOS outperforming the rest.
In our three-way ANOVA, we found significant main effects
for each of the three factors: OS (F(4, 385) = 2053.15, p ¡
0.001), Scene (F(3, 385) = 13650.10, p ¡ 0.001), and Algorithm
(F(3, 385) = 2266.74, p ¡ 0.001). We also discovered signifi-
cant two-way and three-way interaction effects. These results
underscore the complex interplay between the OS, Scene, and
Algorithm in influencing rendering times.
Investigation of the model diagnostics showed a rough
approximation of a normal distribution in the histogram of
residuals, suggesting that the assumption of normality for the
ANOVA was satisfactorily met. However, the homoscedas-
ticity plot indicated that the assumption of equal variances
was violated. Logarithmic transformation of the data led to a
marked improvement in Levene’s test, indicating an improve-
ment in homoscedasticity, and this transformed data was used
for the final analysis.
The Tukey HSD post-hoc test identified specific pairwise
differences among the levels of the factors. This provided a
detailed understanding of the specific combinations of factors
that led to significant differences in rendering times.
Visual representation of the log-transformed Time variable
across different OSs, Scenes, and Algorithms further validated
the ANOVA and post-hoc results. macOS consistently outper-
formed other operating systems in terms of rendering time
efficiency. Particularly notable was the performance of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on a MacBook.
The heteroscedasticity issue, though improved with logarith-
mic transformation, was still present. As such, further research
may benefit from using robust statistical techniques that do
not assume homogeneity of variances. Despite this limitation,
these findings shed light on crucial aspects that could guide
future software development and hardware optimization strate-
gies.
